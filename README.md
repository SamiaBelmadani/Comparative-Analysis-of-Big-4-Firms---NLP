# Comparative-Analysis-of-Big-4-Firms---NLP
Our project seeks to comprehensively analyze the Big 4 firms — Deloitte, PwC, KPMG, and EY — delving into employee ratings, company culture, benefits, and overall sentiment, recognizing the widespread interest in prestigious organizations like the Big 4 among job seekers. We aim to address the need for differentiation between these firms and demystify their distinctions, offering valuable guidance to students and professionals who are considering career opportunities within these organizations. Through thorough analysis of employee feedback and other relevant factors, our dataset, focused specifically on the Big 4, illuminates their unique attributes, striving to offer clarity amidst the complexities of the Big 4 landscape and better inform individuals' career decisions. 

Our comprehensive analytics approach is applied to analyze the Big 4 firms, utilizing various techniques to extract valuable insights from employee feedback. Within our dataset, we specifically focus on categories such as the following ratings: 'work-life balance', 'culture values', 'diversity and inclusion', 'career opportunities', 'compensation and benefits', 'senior management', 'overall rating', and other significant columns such as: 'firms', a review of positive facts in 'pros', a review of negative facts in 'cons', and a general comment in 'headline'. This allows us to perform a comprehensive analysis of employee sentiments, company culture, and other pertinent factors. By employing sentiment analysis, regression analyses, topic modeling, and personalized recommendation systems, our aim is to acquire an in-depth understanding of the nuances within each firm and deliver practical insights to individuals exploring career opportunities.
